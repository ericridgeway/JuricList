# UPDATE: I think this is answered on pg 152, with the promise of followup in ch 7. Not positive tho. The short answer seems to be "for concurrent stuff like 2+ users", something like that, and not caring what order they async ask the questions in... Something
    # The answer might be obvious once you give it, but... I've forgotten why we smetimes
    #   want to do this. add OOP/genserver concept. We don't have to do
    #   todo_list2 = TodoList.do_something(todo_list1, ...)
    #   etc. a bunch of times. But pipelines/the entire point of elixir/functional
    #   goes a long way to minimize that being much (if any) of an annoyance
    #
    #   so what are the situations where we want to use this again? Only when we need
    #   to start thinking about 2+ clients calling it at once or something? And even then,
    #   why couldn't we just hold the passed-back 'new_todo_list' each time or something?
